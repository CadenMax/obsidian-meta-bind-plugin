# Obsidian Meta Bind Plugin

This plugin can create input fields inside your notes and bind them to metadata fields, syncing their contents.
Allowing you to create things like checkboxes inside your notes that change a metadata field e.g. `done` when checked.
Or creating a slider inside your movie notes, that syncs up with a metadata field named `rating`.

### Problems, unexpected behavior or improvement suggestions?

You are more than welcome to open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/mProjectsCode/obsidian-meta-bind-plugin/issues).

#### The sync seems laggy / It takes half a second for the changes to sync

This is intentional. To reduce the load on your hard drive the plugin ony syncs about 5 times a second.
There is a setting to change the sync interval, but I don't recommend changing it.
